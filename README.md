IHP-Cafe
==========
ihp-coffee is a series of short notes detailing features of 
the [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/) Haskell web framework.

Head over to the [IHP-Cafe on St. James Street](https://ihpcafe.ihpapp.com/) for a hot drink!

Coffees should be refreshed daily. They are intentionally short and do not contain hyperlinks.
The idea is you can enjoy a single, daily, short, self-contained drink of `type signatures` and `instances`
to gain familiarity with the package layout in small enjoyable doses.
